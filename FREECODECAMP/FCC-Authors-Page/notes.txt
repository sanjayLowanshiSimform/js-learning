The Fetch API is a built-in JavaScript interface to make network requests to a server. It has a fetch() method you can use to make GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH requests. In this project, you'll make a GET request to a URL for a JSON file with information about authors on freeCodeCamp News.
Here is how you can make a GET request with the fetch() method:

- fetch("url-goes-here")

The fetch() method returns a Promise, which is a placeholder object that will either be fulfilled if your request is successful, or rejected if your request is unsuccessful.

If the Promise is fulfilled, it resolves to a Response object, and you can use the .then() method to access the Response.

Here's how you can chain .then() to the fetch() method:

- fetch("sample-url-goes-here")
-  .then((res) => res)

The data you get from a GET request is not usable at first. To make the data usable, you can use the .json() method on the Response object to parse it into JSON. If you expand the Prototype of the Response object in the console, you will see the .json() method there.

The .catch() method is another asynchronous JavaScript method you can use to handle errors. This is useful in case the Promise gets rejected.
